## About PowerShell

[**PowerShell**](./https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) is a powerful command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It is designed to help users automate tasks, manage systems, and perform administrative tasks efficiently. Built on the [.NET framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/overview), **PowerShell** is both a **_command-line tool_** and **_a scripting environment_**, making it a versatile tool for programmers and system administrators.

> "PowerShell is great because we had a series of rockstar engineers add their awesomeness to the project."

_( From the [interview](https://evrone.com/blog/jeffrey-snover-interview) with Jeffrey Snover, PowerShell Inventor)_

## PowerShell for Beginners

### Basic Commands to Get Started

- `*Get-Command*`: Lists all available commands.
- `*Get-Help*`: Provides help information for commands.
- `*Get-Process*`: Displays all running processes.
- `*Stop-Process*`: Stops a specific process.
- `*Set-Location*`: Changes the current directory (like `cd` in Command Prompt).
- `*New-Item*`: Creates a new file or directory.

### Example Script

Here's a simple script to list all files in a directory and display their size:

```Powershell
# Get all files in the current directory
$files = Get-ChildItem

# Display file names and sizes
foreach ($file in $files) {
Write-Output "$($file.Name) - $($file.Length) bytes"
}
```
